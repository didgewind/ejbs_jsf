	<!-- Empty for now. There are many uses for faces-config.xml, but the most 
		common are navigation rules (instead of having the return value of the "action" 
		method be the base filename), bean declarations (instead of using @ManagedBean), 
		and properties files (aka resource bundles). If you are not using faces-config.xml, 
		it is perfectly legal to omit the file entirely. But, most people prefer 
		to have a blank one already in their project for later use. From JSF 2 and 
		PrimeFaces tutorial at http://www.coreservlets.com/JSF-Tutorial/jsf2/ -->
